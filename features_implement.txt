FEATURES I WANT TO IMPLEMENT:




UI Design Pitfalls:

[Done] 1.) The Scraped text field has zero structure. Can we make sure to adapt it in a way
so that it looks similar to how it looks like on it's original webpage?

[Done] 2.) In AI suggested metadata fields, the AI reasoning is blocked off by ... I want to see the 
whole thing, the cutoff should be done after like 500 characters, and if it's longer than 500 
characters, then you should be able to click on the ... to see the rest of the text.

[Done] 3.) We don't need to see the "Evidence" part within a metadata field on the frontend anymore,
because the evidence is literally being highlighted in the text field. 

[Halfdone] 4.) The highlighting should work well with this new system too!

[Halfdone] 5.) The UI has shit design flows in the metadata fields sometimes

5.2) I don't like that everything is different colors, make purple the main thing, also dark green

6.) There are sometimes multiple values, but they are being shown weirdly

7.) AI Agent 2 finetuning, + it's so slow!!

[Halfdone] 8.) Saving your results

[Done] 9.) Logs for the Use Case

10.) Go over midterm notes

[Halfdone] 11.) IMPORTANT: For the entities that were fully curated, the first page when we click on the
entity shows their metadata fields that need to be populated right? Instead, only for the ones
that have populated each metadata field, (for this source per entity 5/5), we will show it's results
on the first entity page in a not editable way!! only results, and if we click on manually curated
or curate with ai or something then we can edit it again.!

12.) When the last metadata has been curated, the page with 
metadata results has to shown Immediately instead of clicking
on the entity again 

13.) Change the two shitty urls.

-> Use Case playbook

-> Backend should follow RESTful guidelines. No code leaks. No dead codes.






GENERAL:

The numbers in the "Metadata Fields Overview" are not updated.

After curation with the ai, we have the metadata fields. Right now, the evidence is being shown inside the metadata field, and also highlighted in the text. But there is some incoherence. There may be some information overlap, so we need to find a way to show that the same evidence supports two metadata fields if that's the case. And in the Metadata field, i don't want only the "Supporting Evidence", but i also want to read the reasoning of the AI.

Speaking of reasoning of AI, how about we create another AI agent that sums up the results to the user, and guides him step by step until the end, after each metadata field has been either accepted, rejected, edited etc. or filled in manually, can we try to integrate it please? So if we try to do that, how do we register this second ai agent?

I want to see the details of the gpt api that i'm using, and details about my workflow. Each curation workflow, after publishing should show me how much tokens it cost me, how much time the whole process has cost me, and how much money i paid. And also, the "Accept all Pending" button does not work? Check everything. The history should not be erased! when i go back to Pre-Curation page, the Metadata Overview numbers should be changed according to my changes in the post curation

Should I not have an external Database like SQL or something?

Refactoring Frontend: I want everything to be more atomic. Also in the backend. Just like in Software Engineering with Thomas Fritz

Source name should only be selectable, not generatable. Only entity should be addable.

Go over this code again. Three times actually. What improvements and errors do you see? Fix them and give me new suggestions.

Metadata Fields Overview: What are those numbers and titles??

Another AI Agent can come and check whether two curators that work on the same task have created two similar metadata fields, if yes, suggest to merge them

We need more error logging, especially with the API endpoints. What if token limit for gpt is reached?

"How to use this system" should be able to be closed and reopened.



I want to be able to add new metadata fields manually, also giving the option to highlight the text manually. Give option to choose highlighting color manually.

I want the AI to be able to add new metadata fields manually.

Being able to add new metadata fields, and transfer it back using the API.

History does not work yet.

The logging of the metadata fields for an entity is wrong. They should not be added each time, only updated by every time we process the same entity again, keeping it's history.

PUT YOUR CODE ON GIT PLEASE

Pinging empty Metadata fields for other curators?

Give specific order and categorization to the metadata fields. Descriptive/Contextual? What if there are 100 metadata fields?

Being able to stop the AI curation on spot.

How is the Confidence exactly being done? Explain how it's done to the curator in the frontend how it's handled

Afterwards, we do finetuning. But how? With API or on our own via manual updating in our code? Per template?
